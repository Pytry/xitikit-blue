### Xitikit Blue
# by xitikit.org

The purpose of xitiki-blue is to provide a better Java API for authentication and user management in Microsoft Azure. 

https://github.com/Pytry/azure-b2c-oauth2 (current example)
https://github.com/Pytry/xitikit-blue (new repository for API development)

The focus right now is to flesh out the API for use in the "B2C" offering (business to consumer) and it's correlated Graph. The first authentication flow to be implemented will be the OpenIdConnect standard.

Other goals: 
- more example projects
- Spring Boot starter
- API for B2B
- API for classic Azure AD
- Documentation on "gotchas" and recommended workarounds for functionality that is currently not supported
